============================

Greetings! I am currently a master student in Computer Engineering in `Northwestern University <https://northwestern.edu>`_.

I received my bachelor degree in Integrated Circuit Design in `Huazhong University of Science and Technology <https://english.hust.edu.cn>`_. I wrote a `small tool <https://github.com/aiifabbf/sizer>`_ to compute optimal circuit parameters for analog amplifiers as `my undergraduate project <https://github.com/aiifabbf/undergraduate-thesis>`_.

I enjoy coding and building. I also enjoy explaining what I know to people. I keep a `blog <https://aiifabbf.github.io>`_ written in Chinese. It mostly contains my personal thoughts about computers, physics and math. Someday I will write in English. I promise.

My resume/CV is `here <https://aiifabbf.github.io/resume/cv.html>`_. You can open the link and print the web page in Firefox or Chrome to get a PDF version. [#paper-cv]_

Experiences
===========

I was a full stack intern, writing CSS and doing UI tuning in a local data visualization company in 2019 summer.

I am actively seeking a software engineering intern for 2020 summer. I have solved `over 700 problems on Leetcode <https://leetcode.com/aiifabbf>`_.

Projects
========

``sizer``
---------

My undergraduate project. A small tool to compute optimal parameters for circuit components like analog amplifiers, logic gates.

Learn more `here <https://github.com/aiifabbf/sizer>`_.

``steve``
---------

A computer graphics course project. I made a naive 3D engine around WebGL's drawing primitives to make my and my teammate's life easier. This engine supports changing object's material on the fly by on-demand, lazy loading of shader program. I also implemented a simple frame-rate-independent animation system to enable you to program key frames like CSS.

Learn more `here <https://github.com/aiifabbf/steve>`_.

``simple-tcp``
--------------

A computer networking project. I implemented a simple TCP-like protocol on top of UDP to enable reliable transport.

Learn more `here <https://github.com/aiifabbf/simple-tcp>`_.

This blog
---------

My `blog <https://aiifabbf.github.io>`_. This blog is a hybrid structure. I write posts in `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ and Jupyter Notebook, then they are converted to HTML using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. Those HTML are loaded dynamically using AJAX and injected into DOM using Vue.js.

See source `here <https://github.com/aiifabbf/aiifabbf.github.com>`_.

Publications
============

I wrote heat simulation in Python for paper [zhou2020]_.

.. [zhou2020] Zhou, Ling, Yufei Zhou, **Yuchen Shi,** Tianwei Chen, Tenghao Zou, Dongxiang Zhou, and Qiuyun Fu. "Enhancing thermal stability of P (VDF-HFP) based nanocomposites with core-shell fillers for energy storage applications."

.. [#chinese] Pronounce like "shh-yuu-chan". Fine. Call me Benjamin or YC.
.. [#paper-cv] Paper resume/CV looks better if you have `Latin Modern <http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/index_html>`_ fonts installed.
